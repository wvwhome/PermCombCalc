Enumerator and Generator

         Permutations and Combinations are described on many web sites (e.g.,
         <a href="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.comb.perm.html" target="_BLANK">The Math Forum</a>).
         This page focuses on permutations and combinations with duplicates (multiples).
         The calculators handle regular permutations and combinations also.
         The academic level is high school mathematics
         or college algebra.
         <br/><br/>
         <p>
          Terminology used here.  A set (or group) is composed of one or more elements and each element is unique.
          A multiset (or group) is composed of one of more elements and some could be the same.  
          A permutation of the group is the elements arranged in a particular order and number (fixed) of elements in the 
          permutation could be less than the total number of elements in the group.  The total number of elements in the group is 
          assigned to the variable N here, and R is the fixed number of elements in a permutation,  where R &lt;= N.  
          These are known as R-Permutations or R-Combinations.  For a Combination, the order does not matter.
          
          The other elements that are 
          the same kind are called either duplicates or multiples (We're using the terms interchangeably here).
          When we refer to the count of duplicates, we mean the
          total count of all the elements of a particular kind -- not just the additional ones that are the same. 
          For instance, the word DAFFODIL has eight
          elements (letters in this case).  The counts of duplicates/multiples are two for 'D' and 
          two for 'F'.
          
          <p>Here 'enumerating' means the process of counting all the unique permutations (or combinations).
          (The first sense of the word: "to ascertain the number of")
           Though a group could
          be a multiset, the set (list) of permutations is a plain set for the processing here -- no mutliples.
          <p>Also 'generating' is the process of creating all the unique permutations (or combinations). In case of this program, 
          the permutations or combinations are not only generated in some data structure, 
          they are also actually listed on a web page (up to {{ perm_discusss_limit }}).
          
          <br>
          Note: I've borrowed most of this terminology from Donald Knuth's book, <span class="book-title">
          The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP)
          Volume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and Permutations</span> (2005), v+128pp. ISBN 0-201-85393-0.  
          Any errors are mine.
          
         <p>
         Note the differences between duplicates and unrestricted repetitions for the purposes here.
         An example of permutations with unrestricted repetitions is assigning letters and
         numbers (elements) to automobile license plates.
         For three letters and three digits in the English alphabet, the number of permutations is
         <br/> 26 x 26 x 26 x 10 x 10 x 10 =  17,576,000
         <br/> since any letter or digit can be selected more than once.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         An example of permutations with duplicates (multiples) is arranging the letters in a word, such as
         DAFFODIL.  If all (eight) letter permutations is the goal, the number of permutations is
         <br/> 8! / (2! x 2!)  = 10,080
         <br/>However, if the count of four letter permutations is the goal, the answer is not
         <br/>  P(8, 4) / (2! x 2!) =   <span style="color:red">420 incorrect</span>
         <br/> The actual result is <b>606</b>
         <br/> A simple counterexample to the formula above is the count of
              two permutations with duplicates of the
              letters in the word BABY.
         <br/> Simple manual enumeration yields: AB, AY, BA, BB, BY, YA, YB -- seven total.
              However, the formula P(4, 2) / 2!  <span style="color:red">yields 6, which is not the correct result.</span>
              This is the original motivation for this page -- in order to dispel this
              misconception.
         <br/> The solution involves enumerating generating functions -- beyond the scope of high
              school algebra textbooks.  See "Introduction to Combinatorial Analysis" by John Riordan,
              though he doesn't use the duplicate terminology used here.  He also calls 'elements' 'things'.
              In combinatorial analysis these are now called permutations of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset" target="_BLANK">multisets</a>.

         <br/>  (The formula P(8, 7) / (2! x 2!) does work for seven letter permutations of DAFFODIL.
                 This might gave the false impression that this is a general formula.)
